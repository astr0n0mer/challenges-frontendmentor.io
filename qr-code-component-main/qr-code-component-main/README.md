## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Started using BEM notation for CSS
- Gaining confidence in my HTML & CSS skills to build responsive layouts

### Continued development

- Need to practice more of Flexbox and Grid
- Then move on working with media queries

### Useful resources

- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts)
  - This course helped me clear out the concepts with absolute (*px*) and relative (*%*, *em* and *rem*) units in CSS.
  - Really great for people that have a little background with CSS, let's say from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
