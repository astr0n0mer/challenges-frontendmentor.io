## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Extensively used Flexbox for implementing the smaller parts of the summary card component

### Continued development

- I feel I used too much code for implementing a relatively simple card component
- I would really love some feedback on areas that I can improve
